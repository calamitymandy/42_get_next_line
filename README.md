# get_next_line

Project from 42 school

• Repeated calls to your get_next_line() function should read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.

• The function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.

• The function should works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.

• The returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character
